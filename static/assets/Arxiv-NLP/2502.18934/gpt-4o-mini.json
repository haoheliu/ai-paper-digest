    "limitations": "The paper does not discuss potential limitations regarding specific language nuances or dialectal variations within the chosen languages.",
    "new_terms": {
        "staged pre-training": "**Staged pre-training** refers to an incremental approach in training models where initial training is done on less quality data, gradually incorporating higher quality data to improve efficiency.",
        "depth up-scaling": "**Depth up-scaling** is the process of adding more layers to an existing model architecture to increase its capacity and performance without extensive retraining."
    },
    "open_sourcing": "Models from the Kanana series, including 2.1B parameter models, are publicly available to promote research on Korean language models."
