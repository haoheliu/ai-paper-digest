    "relevance_why": "The paper's focus on information retrieval techniques and answer generation using regulatory texts aligns with potential applications in audio data compliance tasks where thorough knowledge retrieval is critical.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "The study explores effective methods for retrieving relevant information and generating responses from complex regulatory documents to aid in compliance-related tasks.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a hybrid information retrieval system integrating lexical and semantic techniques to enhance information extraction from regulatory texts, achieving significant performance improvements.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Traditional systems lag in handling nuanced regulatory language, primarily relying on keyword matching.",
        "novelty": "This work combines BM25 for lexical retrieval with a fine-tuned sentence transformer for semantic understanding, greatly enhancing retrieval accuracy."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The integration of both lexical and semantic approaches allows for more nuanced understanding and retrieval of regulatory information.",
    "real_world_impact": "This system can significantly improve regulatory compliance processes, making it easier for professionals to access accurate information, ultimately promoting adherence to complex regulations.",
    "limitations": "The entailment score (Es) of generated answers indicates potential areas for improvement in ensuring that outputs are well-aligned with retrieved passages.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Lexical retrieval": "**Lexical retrieval** refers to searching for documents that contain specific terms or phrases matching the query, focusing on precise word matches.",
        "Semantic search": "**Semantic search** involves understanding the meaning and context and finding documents that are conceptually relevant, regardless of exact wording."
    },
    "open_sourcing": "The fine-tuned model and methodology are available on Hugging Face Hub and GitHub."
