    "relevance_why": "Utilizing techniques for temporal analysis in texts could inspire new approaches in audio generation and enhancement tasks, particularly for aligning audio outputs with implicit temporal cues in narratives.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "This paper focuses on detecting implicit future references in texts that mention specific entities, aiding in tasks such as decision-making and trend forecasting.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a novel dataset and methodologies to detect future-related references in entity-centric texts, achieving significant improvements in classification performance with transformer models over traditional methods.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods primarily focused on explicit date expressions, limiting their applicability to historical and current contexts.",
        "novelty": "This work effectively trains models to identify future orientation based purely on contextual cues by masking explicit temporal references."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The approach focuses on understanding future context through contextual clues rather than relying on explicit temporal markers, enhancing model learning capabilities.",
    "real_world_impact": "This method could significantly benefit applications in corporate intelligence and urban planning by providing tools to analyze future-oriented statements, supporting enhanced forecasting and decision-making.",
    "limitations": "No.",
    "new_terms": {
        "temporal entity classification": "**Temporal entity classification** is a process of categorizing entities in texts based on their associated temporal contexts, particularly to discern future-oriented mentions.",
