    "relevance_why": "The techniques developed in this paper for real-time data integration and financial decision-making processes could inform methodologies for audio-visual data integration in music generation.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Large Language Models (LLMs)",
    "background": "Handling financial queries by accessing real-time text and tabular data to improve decision-making in finance.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a Financial Agent to solve the challenge of equipping large language models with real-time financial context, achieving efficient answering of financial queries.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Conventional LLMs are limited as they rely on static datasets and lack real-time context integration.",
        "novelty": "This work enhances LLM capabilities by integrating a Financial Agent that dynamically retrieves and contextualizes relevant real-time financial data."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes a dual-module system that includes a data retrieval mechanism alongside a financial context generator, enabling responsive and informed answers.",
    "real_world_impact": "This approach significantly enhances the utility of large language models in finance, improving decision-making and algorithmic trading processes. Companies could adopt these strategies to boost operational efficiency.",
    "limitations": "While the integration of real-time data is a strength, the system's dependency on both the quality of data sources and the adaptation into the existing LLM architecture poses challenges.",
    "new_terms": {
        "knowledge grounding": "**Knowledge grounding** refers to the process of equipping machine learning models with external data resources and contextual information to enhance their decision-making capabilities.",
        "real-time data retrieval": "**Real-time data retrieval** involves accessing and processing the most current information continuously, allowing for dynamic responsiveness in applications like finance."
