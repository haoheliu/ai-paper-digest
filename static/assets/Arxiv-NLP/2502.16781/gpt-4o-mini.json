    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "The paper introduces a multilingual question-answering dataset specifically tailored to assess the impact of Optical Character Recognition errors on QA systems across old documents in multiple languages.",
    "contribution": "MultiOCR-QA introduces a dataset with 60,000 question-answer pairs to evaluate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) when dealing with noisy OCR-generated texts.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous datasets focused primarily on specific tasks without extensive evaluation of OCR error impacts across languages.",
        "novelty": "This work provides a comprehensive analysis of how different types of OCR errors (insertions, deletions, substitutions) affect QA performance."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Combines both Raw and Corrected OCR text, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the robustness of QA systems under varying quality conditions.",
    "real_world_impact": "This dataset can significantly aid in developing more accurate QA systems for historical texts, potentially enhancing the usability of digital libraries and archives.",
    "limitations": "The dataset primarily covers English, French, and German, limiting its applicability to low-resource languages.",
    "new_terms": {
        "RawOCR": "**Raw OCR text** refers to the text output generated by Optical Character Recognition systems that has not been corrected for errors.",
        "CorrectedOCR": "**Corrected OCR text** denotes the cleaned-up version of text after OCR errors have been rectified."
    },
    "open_sourcing": "The dataset is freely available at: https://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/MultiOCR-QA"
