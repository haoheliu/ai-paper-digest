    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The paper introduces a method that combines text and image modalities to enhance reasoning capabilities over tabular data, potentially useful for tasks in audio-language alignment and data structuring for audio-visual integration.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Large Language Models (LLMs)",
    "background": "This research focuses on improving how Large Language Models understand and reason with tabular data by integrating both text-based and image-based representations.",
    "contribution": "The paper introduces the Hybrid-Modal Preference Optimization (HIPPO) model to solve the issue of limited reasoning capability in LLMs when only unimodal table representations are used, achieving a 4% performance improvement over existing methods.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods primarily utilized either text or image representations, limiting the models' understanding of the full semantic structure of tables.",
        "novelty": "HIPPO enhances the model's performance by combining insights from both modalities and employing a modality-consistent sampling approach for training."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The integration of text and image-based table representations in a hybrid framework that optimizes reasoning by addressing modality bias during training.",
    "real_world_impact": "The framework has potential applications in various fields that utilize tabular data, enhancing the ability of models to perform tasks such as question answering and fact verification more accurately.",
    "limitations": "The reliance on multi-modal data may require additional computational resources compared to unimodal approaches.",
    "new_terms": {
        "hybrid-modal preference optimization": "**Hybrid-modal preference optimization** refers to a training methodology that leverages both text-based and image-based data to improve performance on tasks that require understanding complex structures, such as tables.",
        "modality bias": "**Modality bias** occurs when a model shows preferential behavior towards one modality over others, which can lead to suboptimal performance in multi-modal tasks."
