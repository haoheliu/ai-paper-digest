    "author": "William Jurayj (Johns Hopkins University), Jeffrey Cheng (Johns Hopkins University), Benjamin Van Durme (Johns Hopkins University), ...",
    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "The paper introduces methods for selective question answering using confidence thresholds, which could inform future work on model confidence in audio-related tasks.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "Selective question answering allows models to refrain from answering questions if they are not confident, reducing the risk of incorrect responses.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces confidence scores during reasoning to optimize the balance between answering questions and maintaining accuracy, thus improving correctness through test-time compute scaling.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous models typically provided answers regardless of confidence, leading to potentially high error rates.",
        "novelty": "This work applies test-time compute scaling to analyze how increased reasoning time can enhance confidence and decision-making in response selection."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Proposes a method of leveraging confidence thresholds to selectively answer questions based on the computed confidence in answers, effectively reducing the likelihood of incorrect responses.",
    "real_world_impact": "Improving question-answering systems could be tremendously beneficial in high-stakes environments such as healthcare or legal domains where incorrect answers carry significant consequences.",
    "limitations": "No specific limitations are mentioned apart from potential variability in confidence estimates.",
    "new_terms": {
        "selective question answering": "**Selective question answering** is a model capability that allows it to avoid answering questions where it lacks sufficient confidence, ideally to prevent incorrect outputs.",
        "test-time compute scaling": "**Test-time compute scaling** refers to the practice of adjusting the amount of computational resources devoted to generating responses at inference time to improve performance outcomes."
