    "quality": 8,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The exploration of long-text generation methodologies, especially the plan-based approach, can inform and enhance audio-language synchronization tasks, particularly in generating coherent audio narratives or transcripts.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "Long-text generation aims to produce extensive and coherent documents, addressing challenges in maintaining content quality and length constraints in generated outputs.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces LongEval, a benchmark for assessing long-text generation capabilities of AI models, achieving more structured evaluations compared to prior efforts.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Prior methods primarily focused on direct text generation without structured planning, often leading to incoherent outputs over extended lengths.",
        "novelty": "This work incorporates a plan-based generation method, allowing for more coherent and contextually rich long texts, which currently available methods lack."
    },
    "key_innovation": "LongEval's dual evaluation paradigm combines both direct and plan-based approaches to more closely mimic human writing practices in long-form content generation.",
    "real_world_impact": "By improving long-text generation frameworks, this research can significantly enhance applications in automated content creation, summarization, and educational tools, leading to better user experiences in consuming coherent long-form content.",
    "limitations": "The benchmark primarily examines models in the arXiv domain, limiting the generalizability across diverse writing styles.",
    "new_terms": {
        "plan-based generation": "**Plan-based generation** refers to a structured approach where content is produced following a predefined outline or plan, ensuring coherence and thematic continuity throughout the text."
