    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The framework addresses strategy injection which can enhance interaction in generative models, applicable to audio generation tasks where social interactions might be relevant.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Generative Models",
    "background": "The paper focuses on improving agent interactions within multi-agent social tasks by dynamically injecting negotiation strategies to enhance dialogue quality.",
    "contribution": "SOTOPIA-\u03a9 introduces a framework for dynamic strategy injection in social agents to tackle prolonged deadlocks in social interactions, significantly improving their dialogue performance.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing methods struggle with prolonged negotiations and often constrain actions or are task-specific.",
        "novelty": "This work enhances flexibility and adaptability by dynamically adjusting strategies based on negotiation theory, overcoming traditional limitations."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The unique aspect of this framework is its dynamic injection of negotiation strategies into social agents' dialogue generation, leading to better engagement and resolution of deadlocks.",
    "real_world_impact": "Improving social agent interactions could enhance applications ranging from social robotics to customer service, providing more human-like engagements in various settings.",
    "limitations": "The paper does not explore non-verbal communication aspects, which could further enhance social interaction quality.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Dynamic Strategy Injection": "**Dynamic Strategy Injection** refers to the process of adaptively embedding negotiation strategies into agent dialogues to improve interaction outcomes.",
        "Social Instruction Following (S-IF)": "**Social Instruction Following (S-IF)** is the capability of social agents to follow specific instructions to achieve social goals in dialogues."
