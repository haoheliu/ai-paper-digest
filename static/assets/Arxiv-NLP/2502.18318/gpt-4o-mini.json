    "relevance_why": "The methodology of using Topic Modelling and Large Language Models may provide insights on analyzing subjective experience data that could be applied to audio-related domains, such as analyzing auditory experiences.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Large Language Models (LLMs)",
    "background": "The task involves identifying and categorizing experiential topics in open-ended subjective reports related to stroboscopic light stimulation.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a novel pipeline, MOSAIC, for analyzing and interpreting subjective accounts using Topic Modelling and Large Language Models, achieving a structured understanding of phenomenological reports.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods mainly relied on predefined questionnaires and qualitative assessments that may overlook nuanced experiences.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by employing BERTopic and LLM-driven labeling, allowing for a richer exploration of subjective data without bias from predetermined categories."
