    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "The methods and findings on vulnerabilities in multilingual models may inform approaches to enhancing audio and speech applications by improving interpretability and security measures.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Large Language Models (LLMs)",
    "background": "Exploring vulnerabilities in multilingual large language models by investigating how malicious backdoors inserted in one language can affect outputs in others.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces cross-lingual backdoor attacks (X-BAT) to solve the problem of compromised multilingual systems, achieving significant attack success rates across different languages.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous research on backdoor attacks primarily focused on monolingual settings.",
        "novelty": "This work expands the scope to multilingual systems, demonstrating that a backdoor can propagate across languages without language-specific retraining."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes rare tokens as triggers that can transfer their malice across different languages due to shared embedding spaces in multilingual models.",
    "real_world_impact": "Highlights significant security vulnerabilities in multilingual models used in applications like translation and cross-lingual knowledge retrieval, necessitating improved detection and mitigation strategies.",
    "limitations": "The study was limited to six languages and specific model architectures; thus, its findings may not generalize to all multilingual models or languages.",
    "new_terms": {
        "cross-lingual backdoor attacks (X-BAT)": "**Cross-lingual backdoor attacks (X-BAT)** refers to a form of attack where harmful triggers can mislead model outputs in multiple languages, leveraging shared representation spaces.",
        "shared embedding spaces": "**Shared embedding spaces** are regions in the model's learned representation where semantically similar tokens across different languages are mapped close together."
