    "key_innovation": "The method modifies the softmax function output to include a scaling factor based on the input, allowing for enhanced gradient propagation even in extreme cases.",
    "real_world_impact": "The improved softmax mechanism could enhance performance in language models and audio generation systems, making them robust for longer contexts and complex tasks.",
    "limitations": "The requirement to compute the maximum and minimum values for normalization could introduce additional computational overhead.",
    "new_terms": {
        "gradient vanishing": "**Gradient vanishing** refers to the phenomenon where gradients become extremely small, leading to ineffective training in deep networks, particularly in layers with many transformations.",
