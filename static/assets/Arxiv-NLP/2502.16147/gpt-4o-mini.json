    "relevance_why": "This paper's exploration of numerical representations in language models can inform methods for audio processing tasks that involve number encoding, such as temporal sequences in audio data.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Large Language Models (LLMs)",
    "background": "Investigating how large language models encode numerical values by examining their internal representations and comparing them to human-like perceptual models.",
    "contribution": "This research introduces a methodology for analyzing number representations in neural networks and demonstrates that large language models exhibit logarithmic scaling similar to human cognition.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods typically assumed uniform linear representations of numbers in language models, limiting understanding of their internal knowledge.",
        "novelty": "This work employs PCA and PLS techniques to reveal sublinear spacing and non-uniformity in numerical embeddings."
