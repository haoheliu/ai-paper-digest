    "relevance_why": "",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Large Language Models (LLMs)",
    "background": "Assessing the reasoning capabilities of large language models through text-based puzzle games that require complex problem-solving and logical reasoning.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces TEXTGAMES as a benchmark to evaluate reasoning skills in large language models, demonstrating their proficiency and limitations in solving challenging text-based puzzles.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods focused on single-task benchmarks for evaluating reasoning in language models but lacked comprehensive multi-turn interaction frameworks.",
        "novelty": "This work implements a benchmark that facilitates self-reflection through multi-turn interactions, allowing models to improve responses based on feedback."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The benchmark enables LLMs to engage in iterative problem-solving, refining their answers in response to feedback, which is a unique approach compared to existing tasks.",
    "real_world_impact": "By enhancing the reasoning abilities of language models, the findings could improve applications in areas like educational tools, game design, and automated reasoning systems. No immediate real-world impact.",
    "limitations": "The paper notes that LLMs struggle with difficult tasks despite showing some improvement through self-reflection.",
    "new_terms": {
        "self-reflection": "**Self-reflection** refers to the capability of language models to evaluate their previous answers and make corrections based on feedback received during interaction.",
        "multi-turn interaction": "**Multi-turn interaction** describes the ability of a model to engage in extended exchanges, where it can receive feedback and update its responses over several iterations."
