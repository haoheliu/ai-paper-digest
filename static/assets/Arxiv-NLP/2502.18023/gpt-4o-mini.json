    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The paper addresses visual question answering (VQA) models' knowledge boundaries, which can inform how audio models deal with knowledge limitations in similar multimodal tasks.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Large Language Models (LLMs)",
    "background": "The study focuses on improving the response accuracy of visual question answering systems by identifying when outside knowledge is required for effective answers.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a method to detect the knowledge boundary of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) to optimize the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, achieving improved performance and reduced retrieval reliance.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing methods often apply retrieval indiscriminately, which can slow performance and lead to irrelevant information retrieval.",
        "novelty": "This work systematically identifies knowledge boundaries to selectively apply retrieval, significantly enhancing processing efficiency."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The method fine-tunes VLLMs based on automatically constructed data for better boundary detection without manual annotation.",
    "real_world_impact": "The findings can lead to more efficient deployment of VLLMs in practical applications like interactive systems or research tools, reducing latency in retrieving external information.",
    "limitations": "The paper does not differentiate between types of retrieval methods (e.g., text vs. image search) and lacks experiments on larger models.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Knowledge Boundary": "**Knowledge Boundary** refers to the limits of what a model can understand and answer based on its training data.",
        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)": "**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines retrieval of external information with generative models to improve the quality of responses."
