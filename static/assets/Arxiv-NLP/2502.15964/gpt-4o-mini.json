    "relevance_why": "The paper explores innovative protocols for collaboration between small on-device models and large cloud models, which could inform future work in efficient model deployment across different domains, including audio processing tasks.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Generative Models",
    "background": "Collaborative systems where a small on-device language model interacts with a larger cloud model to efficiently solve complex tasks that demand extensive reasoning over a large context.",
    "contribution": "Minions introduces MinionS, a novel communication protocol enhancing local-remote model collaboration to achieve over 97.9% of the performance of remote-only systems while dramatically reducing costs by 5.7 times.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods often relied on inefficient or naive communication protocols between models, which led to suboptimal performance or high operational costs.",
        "novelty": "This work improves upon such approaches by allowing the remote model to decompose tasks into smaller subtasks that are executed locally, enabling parallel processing and better context management."
    },
    "key_innovation": "MinionS protocol's unique approach of task decomposition allows smaller local models to handle complex instructions via parallelism, significantly boosting efficiency and performance.",
    "real_world_impact": "This framework has the potential to make language models more accessible and cost-effective, paving the way for broader adoption in practical applications like document analysis and financial reasoning.",
    "limitations": "No",
    "new_terms": {
        "MinionS": "**MinionS** is an enhanced local-remote language model communication protocol that decomposes complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks executed in parallel by local models to improve efficiency.",
        "task decomposition": "**Task decomposition** refers to breaking down a complex task into simpler sub-tasks, which can be independently processed, allowing for improved parallel computation."
