    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in optimizing decision-making, which could be applied to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of audio processing tasks, particularly in the context of automated dialogue systems.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "Automating debt collection negotiations using advanced AI language models to balance the needs of creditors and debtors through multi-agent interactions.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a multi-agent framework that enhances negotiation performance in debt collection scenarios, achieving better decision-making outcomes for both creditors and debtors.",
    "technical_comparison": "Previous methods mainly utilized fixed formats and lacked dynamic negotiation capabilities. This work improves by implementing a multi-agent system with planning and judging functionalities to optimize decision-making in real-time.",
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes a multi-agent framework that allows for self-planning and self-adjustment during negotiations, improving overall negotiation outcomes.",
    "real_world_impact": "The developed framework has the potential to significantly enhance automation in debt recovery, increasing efficiency and reducing losses for financial institutions in real-world applications.",
    "limitations": "The simplicity of the current multi-agent framework may not capture all complexities of real-world negotiations and requires further refinement.",
    "new_terms": {
        "multi-agent framework": "**Multi-agent framework** refers to a system where multiple intelligent agents interact and collaborate to achieve specific goals, improving the decision-making process.",
        "large language models (LLMs)": "**Large language models (LLMs)** are advanced AI algorithms capable of understanding and generating human-like text based on vast amounts of data."
