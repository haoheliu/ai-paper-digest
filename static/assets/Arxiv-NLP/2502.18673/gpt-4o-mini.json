    "author": "Ian Steenstra (Northeastern University), Farnaz Nouraei (Northeastern University), Timothy W. Bickmore (Northeastern University), ...",
    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 8,
    "relevance_why": "The paper discusses using large language models to simulate patient interactions, which could enhance training approaches in audio-speech domains by adopting similar techniques for training conversational agents.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Training counselors to improve their motivational interviewing skills using a simulated patient that provides real-time feedback based on the counselor's interactions.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a system called SimPatient to solve the challenge of effective counselor training by providing realistic patient simulations and detailed feedback, achieving increased counselor self-efficacy in motivational interviewing techniques.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods for counselor training relied heavily on human actors and limited feedback mechanisms, making training costly and infrequent.",
        "novelty": "This work improves training by using a large language model to offer dynamic, real-time feedback based on simulated patient behavior, making it scalable and always available."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes a multi-agent architecture to create a realistic counseling experience with automated, detailed performance visualizations for skill assessment.",
    "real_world_impact": "The implementation of such a training system could greatly expand access to effective counselor training, potentially improving counseling outcomes in mental health, particularly in substance misuse treatments.",
    "limitations": "No specific limitations were mentioned by the authors, though the dependence on language models may introduce biases or inaccuracies in patient behavior simulation.",
    "new_terms": {
        "motivational interviewing": "**Motivational interviewing** is a counseling approach aimed at enhancing a person's motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence.",
        "cognitive model": "**Cognitive model** refers to a theoretical representation that describes the mental processes of an individual, used here to simulate the internal state of the patient."
