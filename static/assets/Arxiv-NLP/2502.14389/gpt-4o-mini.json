    "relevance_why": "This paper explores the application of small open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational settings, which could inspire similar methodologies in audio-language tasks, particularly in feedback generation for audio processing.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "This research investigates how small models can analyze the structure of student essays, providing feedback on argument quality and structure.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a novel approach using small Large Language Models to perform a complete argument mining pipeline in education, achieving improved segmentation and classification accuracy for student essays.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods in argument mining primarily relied on larger, more resource-intensive models which are not practical for local deployment.",
        "novelty": "This work demonstrates that smaller, open-source models can effectively manage argument mining tasks, proving that less resource-heavy solutions can achieve competitive performance."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The study successfully integrates few-shot prompting and fine-tuning techniques to leverage small LLMs, ensuring accessibility and privacy by enabling local execution on student devices.",
    "real_world_impact": "This research demonstrates the potential for enhancing writing skills among students through real-time feedback, improving educational outcomes while preserving data privacy.",
    "limitations": "The performance on quality assessment was notably lower than desired, indicating challenges with annotation quality.",
    "new_terms": {
        "argument mining": "**Argument mining** refers to the process of identifying, classifying, and analyzing the argumentative structure in written text.",
        "few-shot prompting": "**Few-shot prompting** involves providing a model with few example inputs to learn how to perform a task without extensive training."
