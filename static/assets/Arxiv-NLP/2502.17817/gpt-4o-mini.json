        "prior_work": "Previous methods often rely on pooled representations which lead to information loss and structured prediction challenges.",
        "novelty": "This work integrates scheduled sampling and a task adapter within a generation framework to mitigate exposure bias and improve output structure."

    "key_innovation": "Combines autoregressive token generation with a task-specific adaptation mechanism to improve predictions across various classification and regression tasks.",
    "real_world_impact": "By enhancing prediction accuracy through generative modeling techniques, this framework has the potential to improve a wide range of applications, reinforcing the utility of LLMs in predicting structured outputs.",
    "limitations": "The generative approach may face increased inference latency due to the sequential nature of token generation.",
    "new_terms": {
        "exposure bias": "**Exposure bias** refers to the limitation in generative models where the model conditions on ground-truth tokens during training and its own predictions during inference, which may lead to compounding errors.",
        "scheduled sampling": "**Scheduled sampling** is a training strategy where the model gradually shifts from using ground-truth tokens to relying on its own generated tokens over the course of training.",
        "task adapter": "**Task adapter** is a component that transforms generated outputs from a model into the required structured format for specific tasks."
