    "author": "Jingheng Ye (Tsinghua University), Shang Qin (Tsinghua University), Yinghui Li (Tsinghua University), Hai-Tao Zheng (Tsinghua University, Peng Cheng Laboratory), Shen Wang (Squirrel Ai Learning), Qingsong Wen (Squirrel Ai Learning), ..., Hai-Tao Zheng (Tsinghua University)",
    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The framework introduces a systematic approach to integrate correction and explanation in grammatical error correction tasks, which can inspire similar strategies in audio domain tasks such as speech enhancement or restoration.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "The paper addresses the challenge of providing explainable corrections in grammatical error correction systems, especially for language learners who benefit from understanding the reasons behind corrections.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces EXGEC, a unified explainable grammatical error correction framework that integrates correction and explanation tasks to improve the performance and provide insights into model decisions.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing GEC systems often focus solely on corrections or provide post hoc explanations without integrating both tasks.",
        "novelty": "EXGEC uniquely formulates the multi-task problem as a generative task, allowing for collaborative learning of corrections and explanations."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The framework's generative approach enables the simultaneous generation of corrections and explanations, fostering a mutual reinforcement that enhances model performance.",
    "real_world_impact": "The design offers potential improvements in educational tools for language learners by increasing trust and understanding of GEC outputs, possibly leading to better learning outcomes in writing.",
    "limitations": "The study relies on the EXPECT-*denoised* dataset which may not fully represent real-world language complexities, as it simplifies sentences to one distinct grammatical error.",
    "new_terms": {
        "evidence words": "**Evidence words** are specific words in a sentence that provide cues for corrections in grammatical error correction tasks.",
        "EXGEC": "**EXplainable Grammatical Error Correction (EXGEC)** is a proposed unified framework that integrates correction and explanation tasks in grammatical error correction."
