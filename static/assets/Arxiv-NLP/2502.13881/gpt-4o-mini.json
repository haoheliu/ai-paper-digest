    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The methods developed for conversational product search could enhance user interactions with audio-based product recommendations, enriching user experience in audio applications.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Conversational Product Search (CPS) aims to facilitate product searches through human-like dialogues rather than traditional query inputs, making the process more intuitive.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the PSCon dataset and a framework for CPS to solve inefficiencies in traditional product searches, achieving human-like dialogue interaction.",
    "technical_comparison": "Previous methods simulate conversations using templates, lacking the authenticity of real dialogues. This work improves by utilizing a human-to-human data collection protocol for richer and more varied interactions.",
    "key_innovation": "Incorporation of a comprehensive dataset with six defined tasks (user intent detection, keyword extraction, etc.) and a knowledge graph to enhance CPS models.",
    "real_world_impact": "The introduction of PSCon can significantly improve e-commerce platforms, offering consumers more engaging and productive means to discover products through conversation. This has potential applications in various customer service environments.",
    "limitations": "The dataset is limited in size compared to the vast breadth of conversations that could be generated, which may restrict the performance of the models trained on it.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Conversational Product Search": "**Conversational Product Search (CPS)** is a novel framework designed to enhance product search experiences by allowing users to interact naturally through conversation, facilitating a better understanding of their needs.",
        "user intent detection": "**User intent detection** is a process that identifies the underlying goal of a user's input in a conversation, essential for effective system response."
