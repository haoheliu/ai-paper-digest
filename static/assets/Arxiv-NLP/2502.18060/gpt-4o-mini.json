    "key_innovation": "The paper shifts the dialogue from equating unbiased models with fairness to recognizing that fairness requires accommodating relevant differences among individuals.",
    "real_world_impact": "By redefining bias and fairness in AI, this work can inform better bias mitigation strategies, potentially leading to more equitable outcomes in AI applications across various domains.",
    "limitations": "The paper does not provide empirical data to support the theoretical claims made about bias and discrimination.",
