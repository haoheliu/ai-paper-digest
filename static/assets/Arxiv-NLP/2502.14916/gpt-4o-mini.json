    "quality": 8,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The paper discusses innovative methods for improving automatic coding of diseases, which can inform similar approaches in audio classification and text-to-audio mapping tasks that may require precise coding or labeling mechanisms.",
    "field": "Machine Learning for Sciences-Healthcare",
    "background": "The task involves automating the coding of disease diagnoses using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system, particularly from Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs) which have unique structural challenges.",
    "contribution": "MKE-Coder introduces a framework that leverages multi-axial knowledge and evidence verification to improve the accuracy of ICD coding in Chinese EMRs, achieving significant performance gains over previous methods.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous approaches mainly focused on hierarchical code structures but lacked the integration of multi-axial knowledge and clinical evidence verification.",
        "novelty": "This work enhances prior methods by implementing an evidence retrieval and evaluation module alongside a masked language modeling strategy to ensure coding validity."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The fusion of multi-axial knowledge with a robust evidence verification model enables a more reliable and interpretable ICD coding process.",
    "real_world_impact": "Improving ICD coding accuracy can accelerate clinical workflows, enhance patient care, and support healthcare management systems, thereby having a positive impact on health outcomes.",
    "limitations": "No specific limitations are mentioned by the authors.",
    "new_terms": {
        "multi-axial knowledge": "**Multi-axial knowledge** refers to the diverse aspects (such as etiology and symptoms) associated with disease coding that are used to create a comprehensive understanding of a diagnosis.",
        "masked language modeling": "**Masked language modeling** is a training technique used in natural language processing where random words in input data are masked, and the model is tasked with predicting these hidden words to learn contextual understanding."
