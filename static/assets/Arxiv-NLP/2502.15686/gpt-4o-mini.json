    "quality": 6,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "The framework introduces a novel view-based approach that simplifies complex data relationships, which could help in large-scale audio data management and integrate database interactions for tasks like audio captioning.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "Converting natural language queries into executable SQL statements enables easier access to databases for users without technical skills.",
    "contribution": "V-SQL introduces a two-stage text-to-SQL framework and a novel view-based schema strategy to address the hallucination problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving competitive performance on the Bird dataset.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing LLM-based text-to-SQL methods struggle with complex foreign key relationships in databases, leading to incorrect mappings during schema linking.",
        "novelty": "This work improves upon previous methods by utilizing view-based schemas to decouple table relationships, reducing hallucinations and improving SQL generation accuracy."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The introduction of view-based schemas simplifies the schema by merging related tables into views, thereby helping LLMs to correctly interpret the database structure.",
    "real_world_impact": "This framework could facilitate more accurate SQL generation from natural language queries, enhancing user experiences in data querying applications and possibly benefiting AI-driven customer service or reporting tools.",
    "limitations": "The design of table mappings currently requires manual effort.",
    "new_terms": {
        "view-based schema": "**View-based schema** refers to the creation of virtual tables that simplify complex database relationships, allowing for easier data manipulation without directly using original tables.",
        "LLMs": "**Large Language Models** are neural network architectures trained on vast text datasets that can perform various language-related tasks, such as text generation and understanding."
