    "background": "Improving language models' reasoning consistency by addressing sensitivity to various natural language query forms while ensuring the underlying semantic meaning remains the same.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the syMmetry-ENhanceD (MEND) Data Augmentation to solve reasoning consistency issues in language models, achieving improved robustness and generalization to out-of-distribution settings.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Prior methods focus on enhancing reasoning chains or adapting models, often overlooking symmetry in query transformations, leading to overfitting and inconsistent reasoning.",
        "novelty": "MEND shifts focus from reasoning chain augmentation to symmetry-enhanced query augmentation, thereby promoting better semantic understanding across different query forms."
