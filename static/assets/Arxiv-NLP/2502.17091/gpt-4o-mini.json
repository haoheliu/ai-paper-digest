    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "The methods used to analyze framing effects could inspire similar techniques in audio-visual contexts, particularly in response generation for music or speech.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "This study explores how the framing effect influences sentiment perception in both humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) using a dataset of naturally occurring statements.",
    "contribution": "WILDFRAME introduces a dataset of 1,000 reframed statements to analyze the framing effect, demonstrating strong correlations in behavior between humans and LLMs.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous studies on cognitive biases in LLMs typically use synthetic data or focus on isolated frameworks, lacking direct comparisons with human performance.",
        "novelty": "This work evaluates LLMs in a real-world context, providing valuable insight into sentiment analysis based on nuanced framing."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The dataset construction combines real-world sentiment-rich statements with systematic reframing, allowing a direct comparison of human and LLM responses.",
    "real_world_impact": "Understanding framing effects can help in developing applications that either utilize or mitigate these biases, enhancing decision-making tools or conversational agents.",
    "limitations": "The study is limited to Amazon reviews, which may not generalize to other domains or types of statements.",
    "new_terms": {
        "framing effect": "**Framing effect** is a cognitive bias where people's decisions are influenced by how information is presented rather than just the information itself.",
        "LLMs": "**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand and generate human-like text based on massive text datasets."
