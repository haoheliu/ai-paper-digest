    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 8,
    "relevance_why": "This paper presents methods for decoding language from brain signals using large language models, which aligns closely with Dr. Liu's research in audio and language processing and can inspire new approaches in audio-language alignment.",
    "field": "Neuroscience and Cognitive Science-Brain-Computer Interfaces",
    "background": "Decoding auditory stimuli from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to reconstruct corresponding text or speech.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces Brain Prompt GPT (BP-GPT), which decodes fMRI signals into text, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods used basic mappings from brain activities to stimuli without incorporating language models in the decoding process, limiting the contextual generation of language.",
        "novelty": "This work uses a two-stage training process with large language models (GPT-2) and dynamic contrastive learning to improve accuracy in interpreting fMRI data."
