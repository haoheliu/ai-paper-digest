    "key_innovation": "Combines visual data with acoustic analysis to perform real-time synthesis of ambient sound without needing detailed sound source information.",
    "real_world_impact": "Provides a framework for enhancing audio experiences in virtual reality and augmented reality applications, potentially transforming entertainment, gaming, and remote interaction sectors.",
    "limitations": "While the system demonstrates significant improvements, challenges in diverse sound source integration and generalizability across varying environments remain.",
    "new_terms": {
        "binaural audio": "**Binaural audio** refers to sound that is recorded and played back in a way that mimics the natural hearing experience of humans, often providing a 3D sound effect.",
        "acoustic transfer function": "**Acoustic transfer function** describes how sound propagates through an environment, relating how audio signals captured at different points translate to other points in the same space."
