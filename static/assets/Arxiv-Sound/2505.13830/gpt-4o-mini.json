    "author": "Ye-Xin Lu (National Engineering Research Center of Speech and Language Information Processing, University of Science and Technology of China), Hui-Peng Du, Fei Liu, Yang Ai, Zhen-Hua Ling",
    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 8,
    "relevance_why": "The paper discusses zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis and noise robustness, which are significant topics within speech technology that align with Haohe Liu's interests in audio enhancement and synthesis.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis aims to generate a speaker's voice based on a short audio sample without prior training data for that speaker.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a codec denoiser that enhances noisy audio prompts at the discrete acoustic token level to achieve noise-robust text-to-speech synthesis, improving speech quality.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing methods typically rely on speech enhancement models at the signal level, which can introduce artifacts and increase computational complexity.",
        "novelty": "This work improves on these methods by directly denoising discrete acoustic tokens, reducing noise sensitivity and computational cost while maintaining speech quality."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes a novel system architecture that operates at the token level rather than the signal level, enabling more effective noise reduction in speech synthesis.",
    "real_world_impact": "This approach could significantly enhance the usability of TTS systems in real-world noisy environments, enabling better accessibility for users in diverse situations.",
    "limitations": "The paper does not mention any specific limitations but acknowledges the inherent challenges in speech synthesis from noisy inputs.",
    "new_terms": {
        "zero-shot TTS": "**Zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis** refers to the ability to synthesize speech from a speaker's voice using minimal audio samples without prior training on that speaker's data.",
        "discrete acoustic tokens": "**Discrete acoustic tokens** are the representations of audio inputs that capture significant speech features, used as an intermediary in synthesized speech processing."
