    "author": "Leekyung Kim (Seoul National University), Sungwook Jeon (Seoul National University), Wan Heo (Seoul National University), Jonghun Park (Seoul National University)",
    "quality": 8,
    "relevance": 7,
    "relevance_why": "The paper addresses audio-to-score transcription, which aligns with Haohe Liu's interest in audio processing. Techniques for note transcription could inform similar methods in his work on audio generation and enhancement.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "This paper focuses on converting audio recordings of vocal melodies into symbolic musical scores, capturing pitch, onset, offset, and note value directly from audio inputs.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces an end-to-end framework to solve the challenge of generating time-aligned musical scores from singing melodies, achieving superior transcription performance compared to existing methods.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods rely on multi-stage processes for note segmentation and transcription, which can lead to errors during each stage.",
        "novelty": "This work presents a unified model that predicts multiple attributes (onset, offset, pitch, note value) simultaneously, eliminating error propagation common in traditional methods."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The integration of a new tokenized representation that includes note values allows for direct generation of time-aligned scores in an end-to-end manner.",
    "real_world_impact": "The proposed transcription system can enhance applications in music educational tools and automated score generation, facilitating better access to musical notation.",
    "limitations": "The performance is still dependent on the quality of existing datasets for training, which may limit generalization to diverse music styles.",
    "new_terms": {
        "time-aligned score": "**Time-aligned score** refers to a musical score that synchronizes visually represented notes with their actual timing in recorded audio.",
        "pseudo-labeling": "**Pseudo-labeling** is a semi-supervised learning technique where a model generates labels for unannotated data using predictions from an initially trained model."
