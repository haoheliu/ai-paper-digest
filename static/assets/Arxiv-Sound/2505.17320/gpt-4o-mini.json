    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "The task involves synthesizing expressive speech from Japanese characters, focusing on pitch-accent sensitivity and voice consistency.",
    "contribution": "This study benchmarks VITS and Style-BERT-VITS2 models on character-specific datasets, achieving high naturalness and intelligibility in synthesized speech.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous models struggled with pitch-accent modeling and voice consistency in character-driven speech synthesis.",
        "novelty": "This work incorporates enhanced pitch-accent controls and a WavLM-based discriminator, improving the synthesis of expressive and consistent speech."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The integration of pitch-accent adjustments and advanced neural architectures specifically tailored for Japanese character speech synthesis.",
    "real_world_impact": "The findings have significant implications for applications such as language learning tools, animated character voiceovers, and conversational agents, enhancing user experience through better speech quality.",
    "limitations": "Higher computational demands may limit deployment on resource-constrained devices.",
    "new_terms": {
        "pitch-accent": "**Pitch-accent** refers to the use of pitch variations to convey meanings in spoken language, particularly critical in languages like Japanese.",
        "WavLM": "**WavLM** is a model designed to improve audio signal understanding, often used to enhance the naturalness of synthesized speech."
