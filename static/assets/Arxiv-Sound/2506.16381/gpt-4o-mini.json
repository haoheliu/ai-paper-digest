    "relevance_why": "The paper discusses benchmarks for instruction-driven Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, which aligns well with Dr. Liu's focus on speech synthesis and modeling, particularly in generating expressive audio.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Designing benchmarks for assessing how well TTS systems can interpret and execute complex natural-language style descriptions to improve speech synthesis.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces INSTRUCTTTSEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark for complex natural-language instruction following in TTS systems, achieving improved model assessment for various acoustic features.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing TTS systems mainly rely on fixed dialog or brief prompts for style control, often limiting expressive capabilities.",
        "novelty": "This benchmark provides a structured, automatic evaluation framework encompassing diverse tasks like Acoustic-Parameter Specification and Role-Play to enhance TTS expressiveness."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Combines fine-grained acoustic feature instruction and high-level expressive style directives into a unified scoring system, allowing for more nuanced evaluations of TTS systems.",
    "real_world_impact": "The proposed benchmark can catalyze advancements in TTS technology, making synthesized speech more natural and user-friendly in real-world applications like virtual assistants and educational tools.",
    "limitations": "Potential data imbalance in emotional and role-based instruction categories may affect model evaluation consistency.",
    "new_terms": {
        "paralinguistic information": "**Paralinguistic information** refers to the non-verbal elements of communication, such as tone, pitch, and emotion, which play a crucial role in interpreting spoken language.",
        "Acoustic-Parameter Specification": "**Acoustic-Parameter Specification (APS)** is a task assessing whether a TTS model can manipulate low-level acoustic features such as pitch and speed based on explicit instructions."
