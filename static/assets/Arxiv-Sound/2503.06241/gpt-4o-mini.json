    "background": "Deploying dialogue robots in environments with background noise to improve turn-taking and conversational fluency during human-robot interaction.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a noise-robust voice activity projection model to solve issues related to turn-taking in noisy settings, achieving significantly reduced response latency and improved user satisfaction.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Traditional speech recognition techniques often fail in noisy environments, leading to delays and poor interaction quality.",
        "novelty": "This work replaces conventional methods with a locally processed, end-to-end voice activity prediction model that actively predicts user speech activity."
