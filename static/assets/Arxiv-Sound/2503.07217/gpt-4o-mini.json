    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 9,
    "relevance_why": "The multi-agent framework and use of interpretable control signals in this paper can improve audio generation tasks in Haohe Liu's research, particularly in generating supervised audio from visual inputs.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "This paper develops a system that generates synchronized audio for video content, enriching the sound design across multiple scenes using an interactive, multi-agent approach.",
    "contribution": "ReelWave introduces a multi-agent framework for generating on-screen and off-screen movie sounds, achieving more contextually coherent and synchronized audio outputs.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing models for video-to-audio generation often focus on single-scene contexts or lack interactive feedback mechanisms.",
        "novelty": "This work enhances audio generation by integrating feedback loops between multiple agents, allowing for iterative refinement of sound design."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The framework's role-playing structure among agents, including a dedicated Sound Director overseeing the generation process, is unique to this approach.",
    "real_world_impact": "ReelWave can significantly streamline audio production in filmmaking, creating richer auditory experiences that align with visual storytelling. It could lead to enhanced efficiency in sound design workflows.",
    "limitations": "The video feature encoder used is noted to have limitations with longer video sequences, which could impact performance in certain contexts.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Foley": "**Foley** refers to the reproduction of everyday sound effects that are added in post-production to enhance audio quality and provide a more realistic ambiance.",
        "Cross-attention": "**Cross-attention** is a mechanism allowing a model to focus on relevant parts of different input sources, facilitating better interaction between video features and audio properties."
