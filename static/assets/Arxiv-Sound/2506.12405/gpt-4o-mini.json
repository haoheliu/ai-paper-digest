    "background": "This study investigates the ability to perceive multiple pitches from a single harmonic tone in popular contemporary music, focusing on the music of electronic artist Vitalic.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces listening tests to analyze tonal fission, demonstrating how harmonic complex tones can convey multiple perceived pitches and varying perceptions across listeners.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods mainly considered harmonic tones as transmitting a single fundamental pitch, often overlooking the complexity introduced by tone characteristics and listener perceptions.",
        "novelty": "This work expands on earlier analyses by empirically testing listener perceptions and linking them to specific signal characteristics, thus highlighting the roles of tonal fission in contemporary music."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes an empirical approach with listener tests to examine how different music styles can produce multiple pitch perceptions from singular tonal sources.",
    "real_world_impact": "This research has practical implications for music production and sound design, potentially influencing how artists approach sound creation and manipulation in contemporary music.",
    "limitations": "No significant limitations are mentioned by the authors.",
