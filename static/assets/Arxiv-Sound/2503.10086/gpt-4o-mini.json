    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "The task involves tracking beats and downbeats in singing voice data without musical accompaniment, improving the accuracy of rhythm estimation.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a novel temporal convolutional network-based method utilizing self-supervised learning features and efficient adapter tuning to enhance joint beat and downbeat tracking in singing voices.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing beat tracking models primarily rely on musical accompaniment with rhythmic patterns, leading to poor performance on purely vocal tracks.",
        "novelty": "This work integrates self-supervised learning features and employs parameter-efficient adapters to reduce training and test distribution discrepancies, significantly improving performance."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Combines self-supervised learning acoustic features with efficient tuning mechanisms tailored for variable singing voice datasets.",
    "real_world_impact": "This framework can enhance music transcription and automatic accompaniment generation systems, thereby improving user experiences in music applications.",
    "limitations": "The paper may not address the overfitting problem in cases with extreme scarcity of singing voice data in certain domains.",
    "new_terms": {
        "adapter tuning": "**Adapter tuning** refers to modifying a pre-trained model with a small set of additional parameters (adapters) to adapt it to new tasks without large-scale retraining.",
        "self-supervised learning (SSL)": "**Self-supervised learning** is a learning paradigm where the model generates its own supervisory signals from unlabeled data, typically used to extract meaningful features from raw input."
