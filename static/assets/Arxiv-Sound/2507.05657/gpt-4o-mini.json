    "relevance_why": "The paper introduces an adaptive algorithm for active noise control which could enhance the restoration and enhancement of audio signals, applicable in Haohe Liu's work on speech and audio processing.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Enhancing audio environments by using adaptive algorithms to minimize unwanted noise throughout a three-dimensional space instead of just at specific locations.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a time-domain formulation for linearly constrained minimum variance active noise control (LCMV-ANC) to solve the problem of ineffective spatial response shaping, achieving effective noise suppression with spatial constraints.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Prior methods typically focused only on uniformly weighted error minimization or required ideal assumptions about acoustic paths, limiting flexibility.",
