    "limitations": "No",
    "new_terms": {
        "room impulse response (RIR)": "**Room impulse response (RIR)** is the characterization of how sound propagates from a source to a receiver in a specific environment, affected by reflections and absorptions.",
        "direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR)": "**Direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR)** measures the ratio of direct sound energy to reverberated sound energy, which declines as the distance between the sound source and the microphone increases."
