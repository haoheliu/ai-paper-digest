    "relevance_why": "The paper's focus on multitask learning frameworks for respiratory sound classification and disease diagnosis could provide valuable insights into optimizing model architectures that Haohe Liu might apply to audio processing tasks.",
    "field": "Applications-Healthcare",
    "background": "Utilizing deep learning and multitask learning methodologies to improve the classification of lung sounds and diagnosis of respiratory diseases by integrating patient metadata.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the Tri-MTL framework to solve the challenge of accurately diagnosing respiratory diseases using lung sounds and patient metadata, achieving significant improvements in classification accuracy.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous multitask learning approaches either tackled lung sound classification or disease diagnosis independently without integrating metadata, which limited their contextual understanding.",
        "novelty": "This work uniquely incorporates metadata to inform both tasks, enhancing model generalization and diagnostic accuracy."
