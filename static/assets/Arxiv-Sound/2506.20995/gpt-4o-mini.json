    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Generating audio that accurately corresponds to visual events in videos, similar to the Foley art in film production, while addressing creative and practical challenges.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a novel guided audio synthesis method utilizing Negative Audio Guidance (NAG) to iteratively create distinct audio tracks corresponding to sound events in a video.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods typically generate entire audio tracks simultaneously without modular control or specialized training datasets.",
        "novelty": "This work improves the generative process by enabling step-by-step sound event generation, enhancing control and adaptability through the application of audio conditioning techniques."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Develops a framework for step-by-step audio synthesis using negative guidance to prevent the re-generation of already created audio events.",
    "real_world_impact": "Enhances the efficiency of audio production in multimedia content creation, making it easier for creators to generate high-quality audio that syncs with visuals.",
    "limitations": "No explicit limitations mentioned.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Foley": "**Foley** refers to the reproduction of everyday sound effects that are added to films, videos, and other media in post-production to enhance audio quality.",
        "Negative Audio Guidance (NAG)": "**Negative Audio Guidance** is a novel technique introduced to guide audio generation by specifying sounds that should not appear based on previously generated tracks."
