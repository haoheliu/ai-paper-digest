    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 8,
    "relevance_why": "The paper introduces a novel method for speech extraction using contextual textual cues, which could inspire similar approaches in audio generation and enhancement tasks relevant to Haohe's research.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "This paper addresses target speech extraction from mixed audio streams by using prior textual dialogue history as an implicit cue, rather than relying on explicit audio or visual cues.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces Contextual Speech Extraction (CSE) to solve target speech extraction without explicit cues, achieving over 90% accuracy with minimal dialogue context.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods typically require explicit cues like audio samples or visual data to extract the target speaker's voice.",
        "novelty": "This work improves target speech extraction by leveraging only textual context from dialogue history, enhancing flexibility and reducing the need for additional input."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes textual dialogue history as an implicit cue for speech extraction, allowing for high accuracy without requiring explicit enrollment utterances or visual cues.",
    "real_world_impact": "This innovative method can significantly enhance voice communication in mobile messaging applications, potentially improving user experience in audio messaging functionalities.",
    "limitations": "The model's effectiveness may decline with less contextual information, and performance can vary based on the accuracy of the automatic speech recognition system.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Target Speech Extraction (TSE)": "**Target Speech Extraction** refers to the process of isolating specific speakers' voices from a mixture of multiple speech sources.",
        "Contextual Speech Extraction (CSE)": "**Contextual Speech Extraction** is a newly proposed task that focuses on using contextual cues to identify relevant speech from mixed audio."
