    "relevance_why": "This paper offers a novel approach combining audio transcription with symbolic music tracking, which can enhance Haohe Liu's work in audio processing and machine learning methods applicable to music generation tasks.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Score following involves recognizing the current position in a musical score during a performance, while ensuring precise alignment is maintained in real-time.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a hybrid method that improves real-time music tracking by integrating audio-to-note transcription with a symbol-level tracker for enhanced precision and robustness.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods mostly employed audio-to-audio alignment techniques, which often plateau in performance and lack robustness in real-time applications.",
        "novelty": "The proposed system shifts to a symbolic domain approach, leveraging transcription to compare musical notes as symbols, significantly enhancing tracking accuracy."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes both real-time audio transcription and symbol-level tracking to achieve robust and precise music score following even with imperfect transcription outputs.",
    "real_world_impact": "This work can significantly improve applications like live music accompaniment, automatic score displays, and real-time music visualizations, enhancing user experiences in live performances.",
    "limitations": "The system's performance is limited by the transcription model's latency and accuracy, which might affect real-time tracking in highly variable performances.",
    "new_terms": {
        "symbol-level tracking": "**Symbol-level tracking** refers to the process of aligning musical notes represented as symbols (like MIDI) rather than relying solely on raw audio input, allowing for finer control and adaptation to the score.",
        "online time warping (OLTW)": "**Online time warping (OLTW)** is an algorithmic approach for aligning two time-dependent sequences in real-time, adjusting for shifts in tempo and timing."
