    "relevance_why": "This paper presents a novel pitch tracking method that could enhance Haohe Liu\u2019s research in audio processing, particularly in enhancing the analysis of speech signals and their features.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "This research focuses on effectively estimating the fundamental frequency of Frequency Following Responses to improve understanding of auditory processing in response to speech.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the Harmonic Amplitude Summation (HAS) method to solve the problem of inaccurate pitch tracking in Frequency Following Responses, achieving a reduction in Root-Mean-Square-Error by up to 47.4% compared to standard methods.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods like Autocorrelation Function (ACF) struggle with noise interference and octave errors in pitch estimation when applied to Frequency Following Responses.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by implementing a filterbank that aggregates harmonics while targeting known fundamental frequency ranges, thereby reducing noise influence."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The method uniquely employs prominence peak-picking rather than selecting the highest peak, making it resilient to noise effects in the FFR.",
    "real_world_impact": "This approach has potential implications for enhanced speech processing in clinical settings, aiding in diagnostics related to auditory processing abilities, especially for hearing-impaired individuals.",
    "limitations": "No",
    "new_terms": {
        "Frequency Following Response": "**Frequency Following Response (FFR)** is an auditory brainstem response that reflects how the central auditory system encodes sound frequencies, particularly in speech.",
        "Harmonic Amplitude Summation": "**Harmonic Amplitude Summation (HAS)** refers to a technique to estimate fundamental frequency by summing the amplitudes of harmonics, focused around a known stimulus frequency."
