    "relevance_why": "This paper presents a continuous learning framework using factorization and centralization, which can be applied to Haohe's work on audio generation and restoration, possibly enhancing adaptability to new audio contexts while retaining previous knowledge.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "The task involves adapting speech recognition models to continuously learn multiple languages and accents without catastrophic forgetting, as new datasets are introduced in a sequential manner.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a framework that decouples learning and regularization into factorization and centralization phases to address catastrophic forgetting in speech recognition, achieving better retention of previously acquired knowledge.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods often rely on rehearsal, regularization, or architectural expansions to maintain learned information.",
        "novelty": "This work improves on these methods by using low-rank adapters for scalable learning and a novel averaging strategy to merge learned information back into the base model."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The separation of learning into distinct phases, enabling adaptive model training that prevents knowledge loss during updates.",
    "real_world_impact": "Could enhance real-time multilingual speech systems, making them more robust and adaptable to user-specific audio inputs without the need for extensive re-training.",
    "limitations": "The approach's effectiveness may vary depending on the dataset characteristics, and more extensive evaluation across languages is needed.",
    "new_terms": {
        "factorization": "**Factorization** refers to the splitting of the learning process into distinct stages to manage influences from different datasets effectively.",
        "centralization": "**Centralization** is the process of accumulating and merging learned knowledge from various low-rank adapters back into the main model."
