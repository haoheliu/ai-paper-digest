    "author": "Yue Li (National Huaqiao University), Weizhi Liu (National Huaqiao University), Dongdong Lin (National Huaqiao University), ...",
    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 8,
    "relevance_why": "The proposed temporal-aware robust watermarking method directly relates to Haohe Liu's research focus on audio and speech processing. This approach can enhance tasks like voice synthesis and copyright protection in audio content.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "The study proposes a novel watermarking technique that embeds a watermark directly into the time-domain features of audio signals to protect speech and singing voices from misuse.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the *True* method to solve the challenge of watermarking in audio while maximizing fidelity and robustness, achieving a PESQ score of 4.63.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods often rely on embedding watermarks in the frequency domain, which can compromise audio fidelity, particularly lower-dimensional details.",
        "novelty": "This work shifts watermarking to the temporal domain, which retains finer audio details while ensuring robustness through innovative architecture and an attack simulator."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The method uses a lightweight content-driven encoder and a temporal-aware gated convolutional network to enhance watermarking without sacrificing audio quality.",
    "real_world_impact": "This approach has significant implications for copyright protection in voice synthesis applications, helping to combat deepfake technologies that misuse audio content.",
    "limitations": "The authors do not explicitly mention any limitations in their approach.",
    "new_terms": {
        "temporal-aware gated convolutional network": "**Temporal-aware gated convolutional network** refers to a specialized neural network architecture designed to extract features from audio signals in the time domain, optimizing both temporal detail and watermark extraction."
