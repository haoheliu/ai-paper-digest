    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 8,
    "relevance_why": "The paper explores wearable auditory feedback for speech improvement, which aligns with my focus on audio generation and quality enhancement. The methodology could inform real-time applications in audio processing and speech synthesis.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "The task involves reducing the frequency of unwanted words like filler words and swearing during conversations using auditory feedback through wearable technology.",
    "contribution": "WSCoach introduces a novel wearable feedback system to solve the issue of unwanted speech, achieving improved long-term reduction in usage compared to traditional mobile applications.",
    "technical_comparison": "Previous methods primarily relied on mobile applications for post-hoc analysis of speech patterns, lacking real-time intervention. This work improves by providing immediate auditory feedback via wearable devices, enhancing user awareness during conversation.",
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes smart audio glasses to deliver nuanced, near-real-time auditory speech feedback, which is less intrusive and more socially acceptable than traditional visual cues.",
    "real_world_impact": "WSCoach has the potential to enhance communication effectiveness in both personal and professional settings, leading to better conversational skills and reduced social blunders.",
    "limitations": "No specific limitations are mentioned by the authors.",
    "new_terms": {
        "spearcon": "**Spearcon** is a type of auditory feedback created by speeding up spoken words to a point where they are barely recognizable as language, providing quick and immediate feedback without social disruption."
