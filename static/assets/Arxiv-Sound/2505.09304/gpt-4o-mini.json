    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Developing a keyword spotting system that can effectively adapt to changing noise conditions in real-time with minimal data requirements.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a low-complexity method for continuous noise adaptation using one-shot learning to enhance performance in noisy environments.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods for keyword spotting often required extensive data and longer training times to achieve robustness against noise.",
        "novelty": "This work reduces the data and computation required for adaptation, allowing for rapid adaptation with only one example and one training epoch."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The utilization of one-shot learning for transferring noise resilience to pretrained models significantly decreases resource needs, making it suitable for embedded systems.",
    "real_world_impact": "This approach can lead to more reliable keyword spotting systems in everyday devices, enhancing user experience in noisy environments where traditional systems fail.",
    "limitations": "No explicit limitations mentioned by the authors.",
    "new_terms": {
        "one-shot learning": "**One-shot learning** is a type of machine learning where the model learns information about object categories from a very small number of training samples, often just one."
