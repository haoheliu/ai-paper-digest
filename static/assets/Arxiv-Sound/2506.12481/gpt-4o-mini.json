    "relevance_why": "This paper highlights the integration of audio information in video models, which could inspire methods for enhancing audio quality in multimodal systems or facilitate cross-modal improvements in my research areas.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to improve video model performance on unseen data by leveraging self-supervised learning during testing.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces an audio-assisted approach for TTA in video classification, achieving notable performance improvements through the incorporation of audio cues.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing TTA methods focus primarily on visual cues, limiting their adaptation capabilities under visual corruption.",
        "novelty": "This work enhances video TTA by using audio-derived pseudo-labels mapped to video categories, effectively leveraging complementary audio information during adaptation."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The method uniquely employs large language models to facilitate the mapping of audio predictions to video labels, circumventing the need for retraining.",
    "real_world_impact": "This approach shows significant potential for real-world applications in video classification, especially in challenging conditions where visual data is compromised.",
    "limitations": "No limitations are explicitly mentioned by the authors.",
    "new_terms": {
        "test-time adaptation (TTA)": "**Test-time adaptation** refers to methods that enable a model to adjust to new, unseen data distributions during the testing phase.",
        "pseudo-labeling": "**Pseudo-labeling** involves generating labels for unlabeled data based on model predictions, which can then serve as guidance for adaptation."
