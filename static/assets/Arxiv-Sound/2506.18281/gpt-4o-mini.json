    "background": "Blind source separation aims to isolate and reconstruct individual sound sources from a mixture without prior information about those sources.",
    "contribution": "This study introduces an unsupervised variational autoencoder framework to separate heartbeat and lung sounds, achieving accurate signal reconstruction and preserving essential spectral features.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous techniques like non-negative matrix factorization often require labeled data and can be limited by their generative flexibility.",
        "novelty": "This work utilizes variational autoencoders, which learn structured latent representations and perform effective source separation without labeled data."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The model's ability to learn from mixed signals and perform separation in an unsupervised manner through latent space clustering makes it unique.",

    "limitations": "No limitations are explicitly mentioned by the authors.",
    "new_terms": {
        "variational autoencoder": "**Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** is a generative model that learns to encode data into a low-dimensional latent space and reconstruct it while maintaining probabilistic characteristics.",
        "latent space": "**Latent space** refers to the internal representation of data captured by the model, which enables it to differentiate between various input sources."
