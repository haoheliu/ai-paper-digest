    "relevance_why": "This paper presents significant advancements in singing voice synthesis, particularly through the proposed diffusion model, which could inform and enhance techniques used in Haohe Liu's research on audio generation.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "The task is to generate high-quality singing voices from musical scores using a unified machine learning framework known as a diffusion model, which iteratively refines audio outputs.",
    "contribution": "SmoothSinger introduces a reference-guided dual-branch architecture to improve the synthesis of singing voices, achieving a more natural and artifact-free audio output compared to existing methods.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing singing voice synthesis systems often consist of a two-stage process involving acoustic modeling followed by vocoding, which can introduce misalignments and artifacts.",
        "novelty": "This work improves upon previous approaches by directly refining low-quality audio in a single framework, thus reducing reliance on separate vocoders and minimizing audio degradation."
