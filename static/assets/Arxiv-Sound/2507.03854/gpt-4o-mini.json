    "background": "Active Noise Control aims to reduce unwanted sound at a listener's location using adaptive filters calculated based on noise characteristics.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the Latent FXLMS algorithm that accelerates the convergence of active noise control systems by adapting filter weights in a lower-dimensional latent space instead of directly updating them, achieving faster convergence with comparable steady-state error to traditional methods.",
