    "title": "From Tens of Hours to Tens of Thousands: Scaling Back-Translation for Speech Recognition",
    "author": "Tianduo Wang (Singapore University of Technology and Design), Lu Xu (ByteDance Seed), Wei Lu (Singapore University of Technology and Design), Shanbo Cheng (ByteDance Seed), ...",
    "quality": 8,
    "relevance": 7,
    "relevance_why": "The paper introduces a scalable method for generating synthetic speech using text-to-speech models, which can enhance audio-language tasks, potentially benefiting Haohe Liu's research on text-to-audio generation and audio-language modeling.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Generating synthetic speech from limited transcribed audio in various languages to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition systems.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces Speech Back-Translation to solve the challenge of data scarcity in multilingual ASR, achieving a significant increase in available training data from tens of hours to over 500,000 hours of synthetic speech.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods struggle with the reliance on large amounts of labeled data to train TTS models effectively, often failing to generalize to low-resource languages.",
        "novelty": "This work employs a targeted fine-tuning approach for TTS models, enabling effective synthesis from a fraction of the traditional data requirements."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Demonstrates that high-quality synthetic speech can be generated from minimal real transcribed data, drastically scaling the training dataset and improving ASR performance.",
    "real_world_impact": "The scalable generation of synthetic speech can enhance ASR systems, making them more accessible for low-resource languages, thereby bridging gaps in linguistic technologies.",
    "limitations": "While the approach shows promise, it may not sufficiently capture the complexity of real-world speech scenarios affected by varied environmental conditions.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Back-Translation": "**Back-Translation** is a data augmentation technique where a model translates data from one language to another and uses the generated outputs to enhance training data.",
        "Text-to-Speech (TTS)": "**Text-to-Speech (TTS)** refers to the technology that converts text input into spoken voice output."
