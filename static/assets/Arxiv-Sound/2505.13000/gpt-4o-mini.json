    "key_innovation": "Utilizes a unique dual-stream method that combines self-supervised learning features with waveform representation to enhance semantic content in audio codecs.",
    "real_world_impact": "By improving speech generation efficiency and quality, DualCodec has the potential to significantly enhance applications in voice assistants, audiobooks, and other speech synthesis tasks.",
    "limitations": "The paper does not explicitly mention any limitations.",
    "new_terms": {
        "self-supervised learning": "**Self-supervised learning** refers to a type of machine learning where the training data provides its own supervision through input-output relationships, often used to learn representations without labeled data.",
        "dual-stream encoding approach": "**Dual-stream encoding approach** signifies a processing method that uses two distinct pathways to enhance data representation, in this case for audio compression and synthesis."
