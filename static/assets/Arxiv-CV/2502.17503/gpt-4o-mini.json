    "background": "This study aims to predict the pathological response in non-small cell lung cancer patients by integrating expert knowledge into a deep learning framework to enhance both prediction accuracy and explainability.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the Doctor-in-the-Loop framework to solve the challenge of predicting pathological responses in cancer patients, achieving higher predictive performance and explainability.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods used deep learning with either post-hoc explainability or lacked integration of clinical knowledge during training.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by incorporating expert-driven domain knowledge directly into the model training, ensuring a clinically relevant focus during learning."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The framework combines domain expertise with a gradual multi-view approach, allowing the model to focus on both broad anatomical regions and specific lesions.",
    "real_world_impact": "By enhancing explainability in predictions, this framework can facilitate trust among clinicians, ultimately improving decision-making in cancer treatment strategies.",
