    "relevance_why": "The evaluation methods and dataset established in this paper could inform quality assessment strategies relevant to audio asset generation and enhance multi-modal generative models.",
    "field": "Evaluation-Methodology",
    "background": "Assessing the quality of generated 3D assets from textual descriptions, focusing on quality, authenticity, and text-asset correspondence.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the AIGC-T23DAQA database and a comprehensive assessment model to evaluate text-to-3D assets, achieving improved alignment with human subjective judgments.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing assessments typically rely on 2D evaluation metrics that do not effectively capture unique features of 3D assets.",
        "novelty": "This work integrates projection videos and multi-modal features to provide a tailored evaluation approach for 3D asset quality."
