    "quality": 6,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "This paper introduces contrast enhancement techniques that could potentially improve preprocessing stages in audio and voice recognition tasks by leveraging fuzzy logic models for clearer signal representation.",
    "field": "Applications-Healthcare",
    "background": "The paper presents a method for enhancing retinal images to improve the visibility of blood vessels, which is essential for ophthalmic disease diagnosis.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a combination of Fuzzy Contrast Enhancement and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization to improve retinal image quality, achieving enhanced visibility of vascular structures.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Traditional methods like grayscale and standard histogram equalization often fail to capture fine details in images, especially under varying luminosity.",
        "novelty": "This work improves upon these methods by combining fuzzy logic and adaptive histogram equalization to create a more nuanced contrast enhancement that better preserves vascular details."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The innovative use of linear blending of two different contrast enhancement techniques allows for more effective image preprocessing compared to using either method in isolation.",
    "real_world_impact": "Improving the quality of retinal images may lead to better diagnostic outcomes in ophthalmology, potentially impacting patient care and treatment efficacy.",
    "limitations": "The method may struggle to preserve fine vascular details in high-luminosity regions.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)": "**CLAHE** is a method to improve the contrast of an image by calculating the histogram of small tiles of the image, thus avoiding over-amplification of noise.",
        "Fuzzy Contrast Enhancement (FCE)": "**FCE** uses fuzzy logic principles to identify and enhance different brightness levels in images, making it effective for adjusting contrast non-linearly."
