    "relevance_why": "The methods proposed for handling uncertainty in tumour margins could inform techniques for audio processing tasks that involve uncertainty and ambiguity, enhancing model robustness and calibration.",
    "field": "Machine Learning for Sciences-Healthcare",
    "background": "This paper explores the issue of annotating brain tumours in ultrasound images, focusing on the challenges posed by diffuse tumours and utilizing a confidence-based annotation approach.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a confidence-based annotation protocol to address the uncertainties in brain tumour segmentation, improving the training process for neural networks with clinically relevant soft labels.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Traditional methods focus on discrete annotation, which is often ineffective for diffuse brain tumours due to poor boundary definition.",
        "novelty": "This work improves annotation accuracy by employing a confidence map that accounts for the varying levels of certainty regarding the tumour boundaries."

    "key_innovation": "The utilization of a confidence map that quantifies aleatoric uncertainty directly informs the annotation process in a spatially adaptive manner.",
    "real_world_impact": "This approach may enhance surgical outcomes by providing more reliable visual aids during tumour resections, ultimately improving patient care.",
    "limitations": "No",
    "new_terms": {
        "aleatoric uncertainty": "**Aleatoric uncertainty** refers to the inherent uncertainty in a model's predictions due to the stochastic nature of the world or the data itself, often seen in contexts where measurements are noisy or approximations are made."
