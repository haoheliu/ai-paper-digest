    "key_innovation": "The integration of diverse data modalities allows for improved accuracy in predicting the construction year of buildings, showcasing the importance of multi-view learning.",
    "real_world_impact": "The findings could have substantial implications for urban development and sustainability strategies by accurately estimating building energy efficiencies based on age. No immediate real-world impact.",
    "limitations": "The paper does not detail specific limitations but suggests the potential challenge of missing data modalities during inference.",
