    "quality": 6,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "The VR approach discussed in this paper highlights potential methodologies for simulating cognitive challenges, which could inform future innovations in audio processing or generative audio experiences by integrating similar immersive techniques.",
    "field": "Applications-Creative AI",
    "background": "The study creates a virtual reality experience that allows non-dyslexic participants to navigate a simulated university campus while facing barriers representative of the difficulties encountered by students with dyslexia.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a virtual reality experience to simulate dyslexia-related barriers in university settings, achieving increased awareness among non-dyslexic peers.",
    "technical_comparison": "Previous methods primarily focus on adaptive learning tools for dyslexic individuals without fostering awareness in non-dyslexic peers. This work improves by actively immersing users in challenges that simulate the cognitive difficulties experienced by dyslexics.",
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes a comprehensive virtual environment to allow participants to interactively experience the barriers faced by students with dyslexia, fostering empathy and understanding.",
    "real_world_impact": "This initiative has potential real-world implications for increasing inclusivity in educational settings, encouraging institutions to adopt supportive policies and enhance academic engagement for dyslexic students.",
    "limitations": "The study sample size of 30 participants may limit the generalizability of the findings.",
    "new_terms": {
        "dyslexia": "**Dyslexia** is a specific learning disorder characterized by difficulties in reading and language processing, which can significantly affect academic performance and social development.",
        "virtual reality (VR)": "**Virtual reality (VR)** is an immersive technology that simulates a realistic 3D environment, allowing users to interact with digital spaces as if they were physical realities."
