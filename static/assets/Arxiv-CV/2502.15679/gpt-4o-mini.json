    "relevance_why": "The study addresses the challenges in hierarchical reinforcement learning and imitation learning, particularly in tasks that require sequential decision-making, which can be applicable in audio processing tasks that require multiple sequential actions.",
    "field": "Reinforcement Learning-Robotics",
    "background": "Observation Space Shift (OSS) occurs when visual changes from one task interfere with the performance of subsequent tasks in long-horizon robotic applications.",
    "contribution": "This work introduces BOSS, a benchmark designed to evaluate the effects of Observation Space Shift on imitation learning in long-horizon robotic tasks, demonstrating significant performance drops due to OSS.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods typically overlook the impact of visual state changes during skill transitions and often assume continuous state reachability.",
        "novelty": "This research rigorously quantifies the effects of OSS through a structured benchmark, revealing the inadequacy of existing data augmentation strategies to mitigate these effects."
