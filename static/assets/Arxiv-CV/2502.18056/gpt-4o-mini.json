    "limitations": "No",
    "new_terms": {
        "Masked Image Modeling (MIM)": "**Masked Image Modeling** is a self-supervised learning technique where parts of the input image are masked out during training, and the model learns to predict the missing parts.",
        "Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)": "**Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture** refers to a representation learning framework where the model makes predictions in the embedding space rather than direct pixel-space."
