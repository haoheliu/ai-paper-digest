    "relevance_why": "The methods proposed for enhancing transferability in pre-trained models might be applicable to audio-related tasks where model transferability is crucial, especially in domains with limited labeled data.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Generative Models",
    "background": "Estimating how well pre-trained models adapt to new tasks without needing extensive retraining, which is critical in many machine learning applications.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a novel feature perturbation method to improve transferability estimation, achieving significant performance boosts in existing metrics.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods primarily focused on statistical relationships between embeddings and labels but often ignored model robustness under perturbations.",
        "novelty": "This work systematically alters the feature space to assess both intra-class and inter-class variations, enhancing the robustness of transferability metrics."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The combined Spread and Attract operations create controlled perturbations in feature embeddings, improving model ranking based on robustness to variations.",
    "real_world_impact": "Improves the selection process for pre-trained models in practical applications, leading to better performance in dynamic real-world scenarios.",
    "limitations": "The paper does not explicitly mention limitations of the proposed methods.",
    "new_terms": {
        "feature perturbation": "**Feature perturbation** refers to the deliberate modification of the feature representations in a model to test its robustness and adaptability under different conditions.",
        "Spread operation": "**Spread operation** increases internal class variability, making classification more challenging by pushing data points away from their centroids."
