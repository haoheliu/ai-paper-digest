    "limitations": "No",
    "new_terms": {
        "cooperative perception": "**Cooperative perception** refers to the ability of multiple agents (e.g., vehicles) to share and integrate their sensory data to achieve a more accurate understanding of their environment.",
        "object query": "**Object query** is a learned representation that allows the model to focus on specific objects for tasks like detection, enabling improved communication across multiple sensing agents."
