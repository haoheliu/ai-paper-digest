    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "The approach's efficiency in multi-object tracking may inspire new methods for audio/object tracking tasks, particularly when integrating with textual descriptions.",
    "field": "Applications-Vision",
    "background": "Referring multi-object tracking aims to identify and track specific objects within video frames based on natural language descriptions, enhancing tracking flexibility and accuracy.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the Memory-Efficient Cross-Modality (MEX) module to solve the referring multi-object tracking task, achieving improved memory usage and inference speed, surpassing the performance of baseline methods.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods such as iKUN require end-to-end training and have high memory usage, making them less suitable for resource-constrained environments.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by decoupling the referring and tracking tasks, allowing for a memory-efficient architecture that supports off-the-shelf trackers without retraining."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The MEX module efficiently integrates visual and textual data using a unique attention mechanism tailored for three data sources, enhancing multi-object tracking.",
    "real_world_impact": "The method's memory efficiency and reduced processing time can lead to broader applications in autonomous driving and surveillance systems, where resource constraints are critical.",
    "limitations": "The tracker struggles with accurately identifying composite objects and filtering based on motion queries.",
    "new_terms": {
        "referring multi-object tracking": "**Referring multi-object tracking** is a task that combines object tracking with natural language descriptions, allowing the system to focus on specific objects as described verbally.",
        "Memory-Efficient Cross-Modality (MEX)": "**MEX** is a proposed module that optimizes the processing of visual and textual information concurrently in a more resource-efficient manner."
