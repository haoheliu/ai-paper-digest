    "relevance_why": "The paper's focus on enhancing brightness robustness in color constancy models could inform methods for improving audio-visual integration in generative models, particularly in tasks associated with audio generation from visual inputs.",
    "field": "Applications-Vision",
    "background": "This research investigates how variations in brightness affect the performance of deep neural network-driven color constancy models, introducing a method to enhance their robustness against these variations.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the Brightness Robustness Enhancement (BRE) method to solve the brightness vulnerability issue in DNNCC models, achieving a reduction in estimation error by 5.04% across tested models.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous models focus mainly on chromaticity without addressing brightness sensitivity explicitly, leading to reduced performance under varied lighting conditions.",
        "novelty": "The proposed BRE method improves robustness by generating adversarial brightness images and incorporating optimization strategies to handle brightness variation during training."
