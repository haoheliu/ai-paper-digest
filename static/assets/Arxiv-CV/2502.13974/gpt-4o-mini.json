    "background": "Integrating data from imaging-based spatial transcriptomics and cell nuclei morphology to enhance the classification of cell types in samples where direct segmentation is difficult.",
    "contribution": "This study introduces SEFI (Segmentation-Free Integration) to solve the challenge of nuclei segmentation in spatial transcriptomics, achieving improved clustering of gene expression data through self-supervised learning of morphological features.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods often rely on segmentation which can be challenging due to densification and complexity in tissue structure.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by employing a segmentation-free approach that uses morphological representations to enhance clustering accuracy."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Utilizes self-supervised learning to extract and leverage morphological features from imaging data without requiring explicit segmentation.",
    "real_world_impact": "The method could significantly streamline genomic research in complex tissues like the retina, potentially leading to better understanding of developmental biology and diseases.",
    "limitations": "No explicit limitations are mentioned by the authors.",
