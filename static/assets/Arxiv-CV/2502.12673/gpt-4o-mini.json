    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "The method combines NeRFs for high-detail object visualization, which can inspire techniques for audio-visual probes or data alignment in audio processing.",
    "field": "Applications-Vision",
    "background": "Enhancing the visualization of specific objects within large-scale scenes using deep learning techniques to create high-fidelity, detailed views while maintaining overall scene understanding.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the ROI-NeRFs framework to solve the challenge of visualizing detailed objects in cultural heritage scenes, achieving high-resolution renderings without significantly increasing computation time.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods often used a single NeRF for the entire scene, limiting detail around objects of interest.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by decomposing the scene into a lower-detail scene NeRF and multiple higher-detail NeRFs for specific objects, leveraging automatic camera grouping for targeted training."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The framework allows for targeted detail enhancement only for regions of interest while maintaining efficiency, enabling the simultaneous rendering of multiple objects.",
    "real_world_impact": "This approach has significant implications for cultural heritage preservation, museum exhibitions, and interactive applications, potentially offering enhanced educational experiences for users.",
    "limitations": "The method may require careful camera positioning during the training phase and struggles with reflective surfaces.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)": "**Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)** are a type of deep learning model used for synthesizing novel views of complex 3D scenes by learning from a set of 2D images.",
        "Region of Interest (ROI)": "**Region of Interest (ROI)** refers to a specific part of a visual scene that is of particular interest, often requiring higher detail and resolution during visualization."
