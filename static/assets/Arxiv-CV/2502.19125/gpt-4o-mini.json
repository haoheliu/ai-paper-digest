    "author": "Ziyuan Luo (Hong Kong Baptist University), Anderson Rocha (University of Campinas), Boxin Shi (Peking University), Qing Guo (A*STAR), Haoliang Li (City University of Hong Kong), Renjie Wan (Hong Kong Baptist University), ...",
    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "The watermarking methods introduced might be applicable to audio content protection or similar generative models where copyright enforcement is necessary, which aligns with the themes of audio and music generation.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "The paper focuses on watermarking techniques specifically designed for Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to protect copyrights against unauthorized use while maintaining the visual quality of the rendered images.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a novel watermarking method called NeRF Signature that employs a Codebook-aided Signature Embedding system to incorporate signatures into NeRF, achieving high imperceptibility and robustness without altering the model structure.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing NeRF watermarking methods like CopyRNeRF and others rely on separate external modules for embedding signatures or require extensive fine-tuning, compromising imperceptibility and robustness.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by directly integrating watermark signatures into NeRF parameters without structural changes, allowing quick updates without the need for retraining."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The method leverages an optimizable signature codebook to embed signatures seamlessly, making it more efficient and robust against malicious attacks.",
    "real_world_impact": "By enabling effective copyright protection for NeRF-generated content, this work could significantly influence how digital assets are managed and protected, enhancing creators' rights in increasingly digital landscapes.",
    "limitations": "No limitations were explicitly mentioned by the authors.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)": "**Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)** is a novel representation method in 3D graphics that uses deep learning to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images.",
        "Codebook-aided Signature Embedding": "**Codebook-aided Signature Embedding** refers to a strategy where signatures are stored in a compact codebook and embedded into a model without altering its core architecture."
