    "quality": 8,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The paper discusses methods for generating 360-degree panoramas from text, which may inspire novel techniques for audio-data representation, potentially enhancing Haohe's audio generation work through improved visual contexts for sound-related tasks.",
    "field": "Applications-Creative AI",
    "background": "The paper explores the synthesis of 360-degree panoramic images directly from textual descriptions, enabling immersive visual content that can be useful in VR, AR, and other creative domains.",
    "contribution": "This survey introduces a comprehensive overview of text-driven 360-degree panorama generation methods, identifying key algorithms and their applications while outlining current challenges and future research directions.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous studies focus on generating 2D images or limited field-of-view panoramas, often struggling with resolution and geometrical consistency in 360-degree outputs.",
        "novelty": "This work systematically categorizes methods into two paradigms: Text-Only Generation and Text-Driven Narrow Field-of-View Outpainting, providing a clear framework for comparison."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Presents a structured approach to text-driven panorama generation, detailing various models and datasets, thus establishing a foundation for future work in the field.",
    "real_world_impact": "The advancements in 360-degree panorama generation can transform content creation in virtual reality and gaming, leading to richer user experiences.",
    "limitations": "The methods examined still face challenges in resolution and maintaining geometric fidelity, particularly at the poles of the panorama.",
    "new_terms": {
        "equirectangular projection": "**Equirectangular projection** is a mapping of spherical images into a rectangular format, which maintains consistent longitudinal spacing but can introduce distortions, especially at the poles.",
        "narrow field-of-view (NFoV)": "**Narrow field-of-view (NFoV)** refers to a limited angle of sight that captures a smaller section of a scene, contrasting with the broad perspective covered by 360-degree imagery."
