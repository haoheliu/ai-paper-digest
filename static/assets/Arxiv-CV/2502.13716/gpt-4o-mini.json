    "limitations": "The performance may vary under extremely complex motion scenarios, which could potentially limit its applicability in highly dynamic environments.",
    "new_terms": {
        "event cameras": "**Event cameras** are bio-inspired sensors that detect changes in brightness at a micro-second resolution rather than capturing full frames, providing temporal data that can significantly enhance motion tracking.",
        "bidirectional motion fields": "**Bidirectional motion fields** refer to the flow fields that estimate motion from one frame to another in both directions, allowing for more accurate interpolation between two frames."
