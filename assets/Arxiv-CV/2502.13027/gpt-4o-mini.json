    "quality": 8,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The EAGLE framework introduces an innovative method for image analysis that emphasizes feature selection and efficiency, which could inform audio feature extraction techniques by promoting focused data processing.",
    "field": "Applications-Healthcare",
    "background": "This research develops an efficient deep learning framework to analyze pathology images by selectively focusing on clinically relevant regions within whole slide images.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces EAGLE (Efficient Approach for Guided Local Examination) to solve the inefficiencies in current pathology image analysis, achieving a processing time of 2.27 seconds per slide, improving efficiency by over 99% compared to existing models.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous models required processing thousands of image tiles per whole slide image, leading to significant computational inefficiencies.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by selectively analyzing informative regions instead of all image tiles, thereby reducing the computational load while maintaining performance."
    },
    "key_innovation": "EAGLE uniquely focuses on a small subset of informative tiles, mirroring pathologists' diagnostic strategies, enabling quicker and more interpretable results.",
    "real_world_impact": "The framework enhances the efficiency of pathology workflows, allowing for real-time analysis and improving accessibility in clinical settings, which could ultimately lead to better patient outcomes.",
    "limitations": "The performance may vary in highly heterogeneous tumors or specific tissue analyses not addressed in the study.",
    "new_terms": {
        "whole slide images (WSIs)": "**Whole slide images (WSIs)** are high-resolution digital representations of tissue samples used in pathology, allowing for comprehensive analysis of specimens.",
        "AUROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)": "**AUROC** is a performance measurement for classification problems at various thresholds, reflecting the model's ability to distinguish between classes."
