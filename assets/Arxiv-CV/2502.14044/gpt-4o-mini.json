    "new_terms": {
        "visual rejection sampling": "**Visual rejection sampling** is a technique where multiple explanations are generated, and the best-fit explanation is selected based on predefined criteria to ensure higher quality training data.",
        "Information Bottleneck (IB)": "**Information Bottleneck (IB)** is a method that seeks a compressed representation of data which retains maximum information about the relevant variable (e.g., the image while removing irrelevant features)."
