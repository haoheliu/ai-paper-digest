    "new_terms": {
        "monocular depth estimation": "**Monocular depth estimation** is the process of estimating the distance of objects from a single image, as opposed to stereo vision which uses two or more images.",
        "sparse LiDAR point clouds": "**Sparse LiDAR point clouds** refer to three-dimensional data collected by Light Detection and Ranging sensors, where points represent reflections from various surfaces but may lack continuity.",
        "consistent supervision method": "**Consistent supervision method** is a training technique that ensures predictions match ground truth data consistently across different sensor outputs."
