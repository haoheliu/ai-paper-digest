    "relevance_why": "",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Neural Architectures",
    "background": "Skyline detection is the task of identifying the boundary between sky and non-sky regions in images, which is vital for applications such as geolocation and flight control.",
    "contribution": "YUNet introduces an UNet-like architecture built upon YOLOv11 to enhance sky region segmentation and skyline detection, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.9858 and an average error of 1.36 pixels.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous skyline detection methods either lack robustness under varying weather conditions or do not effectively segment images.",
        "novelty": "This work improves upon existing architectures by integrating multi-scale feature extraction and fusion, thereby enhancing contextual information for more accurate segmentation."
    },
    "key_innovation": "YUNet's unique architecture combines the strengths of YOLOv11 for object detection with UNet's semantic segmentation capabilities, producing a model adept in complex environments.",
    "real_world_impact": "This method provides a practical solution for reliable skyline detection necessary in applications such as navigation and surveillance, enhancing safety and operational efficiency.",
    "limitations": "No limitations were explicitly mentioned by the authors.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Skyline detection": "**Skyline detection** refers to the process of identifying the separation line between the sky and other elements in an image, a key task for geographic and navigation applications.",
        "Intersection over Union (IoU)": "**Intersection over Union (IoU)** is a common metric used to measure the accuracy of an object detection model, calculated as the area of overlap between the predicted and ground truth regions divided by the area of their union."
