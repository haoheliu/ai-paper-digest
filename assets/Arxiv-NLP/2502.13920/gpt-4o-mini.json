    "author": "Xingbo Wang (Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University), Joey Castillo (Cornell Tech), Janessa Griffith (Cornell Tech), Tanzeem Choudhury (Cornell Tech), Daniel A. Adler (Cornell Tech), Fei Wang (Weill Cornell Medicine), ...",
    "quality": 8,
    "relevance": 7,
    "relevance_why": "This paper presents a novel system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with wearable data to provide personalized health recommendations, which could inspire similar integrations in audio processing and analysis.",
    "field": "Applications-Healthcare",
    "background": "Personalized health interventions often fail to adapt to individual contexts; this work addresses that by using wearable data and behavioral theories to enhance sleep health through a chatbot.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces HEALTHGURU, an LLM-powered chatbot to solve the limitations of existing sleep health applications, achieving improved sleep duration and user engagement.",
    "technical_comparison": "Previous methods mainly offered static recommendations based on general metrics, thus lacking personalization. This work improves on that by utilizing a contextual multi-armed bandit model to tailor recommendations dynamically based on real-time data and behavioral theories.",
    "key_innovation": "Combines behavioral change theories with real-time data from wearables to deliver actionable, context-aware recommendations through conversational interfaces.",
    "real_world_impact": "HEALTHGURU shows potential to significantly improve sleep health and user behavior by providing tailored advice, which could lead to broader applications in health tech.",
    "limitations": "The need for ongoing user data to refine recommendations may limit immediate usability for new users with little data history.",
    "new_terms": {
        "multi-armed bandit model": "**Multi-armed bandit model** is a machine learning approach used for optimizing decision-making, balancing exploration of new alternatives and exploitation of known successful choices.",
        "wearable data": "**Wearable data** refers to health data collected through devices worn on the body, which monitor various physiological metrics."
