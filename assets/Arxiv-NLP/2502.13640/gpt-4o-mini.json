    "quality": 8,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "The insights on evaluating multilingual language model safety could inform approaches to robustify audio and speech processing models, particularly in code-switching scenarios.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "The paper examines the risks and safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) in a bilingual Kazakh-Russian context, highlighting the challenges posed by cultural nuances and code-switching.",
    "contribution": "Qorgau introduces a novel safety evaluation dataset tailored for Kazakh and Russian, addressing bilingual risks and model behavior in this specific linguistic context.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods mainly focused on monolingual models, especially for English, which failed to capture the complexities of bilingual interactions.",
        "novelty": "This work uniquely combines a bilingual dataset with a systematic framework for evaluating models on region-specific risks, influencing multilingual safety assessments."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The dataset includes unique cultural and regional prompts, as well as code-switching questions reflecting the natural language use in Kazakhstan.",
    "real_world_impact": "The findings can enhance the safety and reliability of language models used in multilingual settings, fostering more responsible deployment in linguistically diverse regions.",
    "limitations": "The cultural complexities of Kazakhstan and certain nuances may not be fully represented, potentially limiting the breadth of the findings.",
    "new_terms": {
        "code-switching": "**Code-switching** refers to the practice of alternating between two or more languages or dialects in a single conversation or utterance.",
        "low-resource language": "**Low-resource language** describes languages that have limited amounts of available data for natural language processing compared to high-resource languages like English."
    },
    "open_sourcing": "The dataset and code are publicly available."
