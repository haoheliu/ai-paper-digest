    "relevance_why": "The methodology of integrating Concept Layers (CLs) into large language models (LLMs) could enhance interpretability and intervenability in audio-related tasks, aiding in better understanding and refining existing audio models.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "Improving the transparency and adjustability of large language models to better understand their decision-making processes and mitigate issues like bias.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces Concept Layers (CLs) to enhance existing models' interpretability and intervenability, achieving seamless integration without significant architectural changes.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous models like Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) required labeled datasets and significant architectural restructuring.",
        "novelty": "This work allows for automatic concept selection from an ontology and integrates CLs in existing architectures, preserving model performance."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The ability to project internal representations into an interpretable space dynamically while allowing for real-time interventions without extensive retraining.",
    "real_world_impact": "The findings could significantly influence fields requiring accountability in model predictions like healthcare, finance, and legal systems by providing tools for bias mitigation.",
    "limitations": "The welding process needed for model adaptation introduces a computational cost and depends on the retention of latent representations.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Concept Layers": "**Concept Layers** are non-trainable modules added to models to project their internal representations into an understandable conceptual space, enhancing both interpretability and user intervention.",
        "welding": "**Welding** refers to a training phase necessary to adapt existing model parameters to work with newly integrated Concept Layers."
