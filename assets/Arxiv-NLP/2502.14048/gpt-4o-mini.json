    "author": "Karl John Villardar (Cebu Institute of Technology), ...",
    "quality": 6,
    "relevance": 7,
    "relevance_why": "The techniques proposed can be applied to enhance context-aware systems in audio and speech processing, improving response generation and interaction with large language models.",
    "field": "Applications-Speech and Audio",
    "background": "The study focuses on improving natural language processing capabilities by reformulating prompts and filtering context to generate more coherent and relevant responses in context-aware systems.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces Semantic Decomposition and Selective Context Filtering to solve issues of context loss and incoherence in processing natural language inputs, achieving enhanced user-facing responses.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Prior methods often struggle with contextual coherence due to limited context window sizes and irrelevant inputs.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by systematically structuring prompts and continuously filtering context to retain only relevant information."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Combines two novel techniques that enhance the ability of language models to understand and generate responses by ensuring context relevance and coherence.",
    "real_world_impact": "These techniques could significantly improve applications in customer service, healthcare, and educational technologies by creating more intelligent and responsive interfaces.",
    "limitations": "No specific limitations mentioned by the authors.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Semantic Decomposition": "**Semantic Decomposition** is the process of breaking down natural language prompts into structured components that can be easily parsed by automated systems.",
        "Selective Context Filtering": "**Selective Context Filtering** refers to dynamically removing irrelevant information from context inputs to improve response coherence."
