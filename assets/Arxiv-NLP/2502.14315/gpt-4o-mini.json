    "title": "Unveiling Cultural Blind Spots: Analyzing the Limitations of mLLMs in Procedural Text Comprehension",
    "author": "Amir Hossein Yari (Sharif University of Technology), Fajri Koto (Department of Natural Language Processing, MBZUAI)",
    "quality": 8,
    "relevance": 7,
    "relevance_why": "This paper presents the CAPTex dataset which evaluates multilingual large language models on procedural texts across different cultural contexts. This could provide insights into developing audio-language models for culturally adaptive speech synthesis and generation.",
    "field": "Applications-Language",
    "background": "The study assesses multilingual large language models' ability to understand procedural texts, focusing on culturally specific instructions crucial for accurate task execution in diverse domains.",
    "contribution": "The paper introduces CAPTex, a benchmark dataset for evaluating mLLMs on culturally diverse procedural texts across seven languages, addressing gaps in understanding and cultural representation within these models.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing benchmarks primarily focus on high-resource languages and generic texts, often overlooking cultural specificity and the intricacies involved in procedural text comprehension.",
        "novelty": "This work integrates cultural contextualization into the evaluation framework, expanding beyond general procedural benchmarks to include task-specific assessments across multiple languages."
    },
    "key_innovation": "CAPTex promotes the evaluation of mLLMs through culturally aware benchmarks, highlighting performance discrepancies across high and low-resource languages in understanding procedural content.",
    "real_world_impact": "The findings aim to enhance the applicability of language models in real-world applications like multi-lingual technical support, cultural instruction automation, and AI-driven educational tools across diverse cultural contexts.",
    "limitations": "The dataset is limited to seven countries and may not encompass the full spectrum of cultural diversity, potentially restricting its generalizability.",
    "new_terms": {
        "mLLMs": "**Multilingual Large Language Models** are language models designed to process and generate text across multiple languages, often leveraging large datasets to improve their linguistic capabilities."
