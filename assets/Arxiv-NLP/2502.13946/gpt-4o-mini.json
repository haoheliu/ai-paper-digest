    "key_innovation": "Reveals the systematic shift in attention towards template regions when processing harmful inputs, highlighting a key vulnerability within safety mechanisms.",
    "real_world_impact": "Understanding these vulnerabilities allows for the development of more resilient models, potentially applicable to various domains including speech and audio systems.",
    "limitations": "No direct solutions implemented; primarily a conceptual framework with proposed methods lacking extensive validation.",
    "new_terms": {
        "Template-Anchored Safety Alignment (TASA)": "**Template-Anchored Safety Alignment (TASA)** refers to the phenomenon where the safety mechanisms of language models overly depend on information derived from fixed template regions, which can lead to vulnerabilities during adversarial attacks."
