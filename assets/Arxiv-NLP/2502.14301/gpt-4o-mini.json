    "field": "Evaluation-Methodology",
    "background": "Developing a comprehensive evaluation suite that assesses the linguistic and cultural competencies of Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically targeting Southeast Asian languages.",
    "contribution": "SEA-HELM introduces a holistic evaluation framework comprising five core pillars to solve the challenge of inadequate benchmarks for Southeast Asian languages, achieving a systematic method for multilingual evaluation.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Existing benchmarks primarily focus on high-resource languages and often use machine translation for lower-resource languages, leading to a lack of cultural representation and linguistic accuracy.",
        "novelty": "This work integrates localized datasets and community involvement, ensuring culturally relevant evaluation for Southeast Asian languages, which improves authenticity and relevance."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Incorporates community participation to ensure cultural authenticity and linguistic accuracy in evaluating LLMs.",
    "real_world_impact": "This framework serves as a significant resource for AI practitioners in Southeast Asia, enhancing the performance and safety of LLM applications across diverse languages and cultures.",
    "limitations": "The evaluation is not exhaustive in language coverage and is based on single model runs without published error bars.",
    "new_terms": {
        "SEA": "**Southeast Asia**, a region of Asia that includes countries like Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.",
        "LLM": "**Large Language Models**, artificial intelligence models that are trained to understand and generate human language."
