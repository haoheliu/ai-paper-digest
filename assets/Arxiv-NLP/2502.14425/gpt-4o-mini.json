    "author": "Yuxing Cheng (Jilin University), Yi Chang (Jilin University), Yuan Wu (Jilin University), ..., Yuan Wu (Jilin University)",
    "quality": 8,
    "relevance": 6,
    "relevance_why": "This paper discusses data contamination in Large Language Models (LLMs), which is relevant to improving the robustness of machine learning models, potentially applicable to audio-related applications such as text-to-audio generation. Understanding contamination can help in ensuring the integrity of datasets used in Haohe's research.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Large Language Models (LLMs)",
    "background": "Data contamination occurs when training data overlaps with test data, leading to inflated performance metrics in machine learning models.",
    "contribution": "This survey introduces an overview of data contamination in LLMs and reviews methods for contamination-free evaluation, aiming to enhance the validity of model assessments.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous studies typically focus on single aspects of data contamination or evaluation methodologies, often lacking a comprehensive framework.",
        "novelty": "This work categorizes contamination detection methods into three paradigms and emphasizes dynamic benchmarks, offering a more holistic view of the issue."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Provides a structured approach to understanding data contamination and its impacts on evaluation metrics, guiding future research towards more reliable evaluation frameworks.",
    "real_world_impact": "Addressing data contamination can enhance the reliability of machine learning applications across various fields, ensuring that models developed for tasks like speech synthesis or audio processing are robust and trustworthy.",
    "limitations": "The survey may not cover the latest emerging methods or models that address data contamination, as it reflects knowledge up to October 2023.",
    "new_terms": {
        "data contamination": "**Data contamination** refers to the unintentional overlap between training and testing datasets, which can lead to misleading assessments of a model's generalization ability.",
        "dynamic benchmarks": "**Dynamic benchmarks** are evolving evaluation frameworks that adapt evaluation criteria and datasets over time to prevent contamination and ensure more reliable assessments."
