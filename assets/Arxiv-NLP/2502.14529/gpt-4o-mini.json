    "background": "This paper discusses a method for attacking multi-agent systems that use large language models, where agents interact to complete complex tasks. The focus is on how these attacks can reduce system availability and waste computational resources.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces the Contagious Recursive Blocking Attacks (CORBA) to disrupt multi-agent systems using large language models, achieving significant reductions in system availability and computational efficiency.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods of attack mainly focused on misinformation and simple blocking without considering recursive behavior.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by employing a recursive mechanism that allows blocking attacks to propagate across multiple agents and network topologies, leading to higher impacts."
    },
    "key_innovation": "CORBA uniquely combines contagious properties with recursive behaviors to effectively spread the attack across agents, ensuring sustained disruption.",
    "real_world_impact": "This research highlights vulnerabilities in large language model-based systems, indicating a pressing need for enhanced security measures in AI applications and simulations.",
    "limitations": "No",
    "new_terms": {
        "LLM-MAS": "**Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems** are frameworks that enable multiple agents powered by large language models to collaborate and execute complex tasks.",
        "blocking attack": "**Blocking attack** is a form of cyber attack that aims to limit the functionality and availability of a system by monopolizing its computational resources through repeated useless instructions."
