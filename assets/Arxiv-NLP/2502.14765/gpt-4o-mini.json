    "title": "Step-by-Step Fact Verification System for Medical Claims with Explainable Reasoning",
    "author": "Juraj Vladika (Technical University of Munich), Ivana Hacajov\u00e1 (Technical University of Munich), Florian Matthes (Technical University of Munich)",
    "quality": 7,
    "relevance": 5,
    "relevance_why": "The paper explores fact verification methodologies which could be adapted for audio and speech applications by enhancing the verification of medical claims through LLMs, potentially benefiting audio-related datasets where accuracy and reliability are essential.",
    "field": "Applications-Healthcare",
    "background": "This work addresses verifying medical claims by iteratively generating questions to collect evidence, ultimately improving the veracity assessment process over previous automated methods.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces a step-by-step fact verification system that iteratively gathers evidence for medical claims, achieving improved performance over traditional methods in terms of accuracy.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods typically employed a static three-part pipeline for fact verification which relied heavily on pre-selected evidence leading to limited contextual understanding.",
        "novelty": "This work enhances the process by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to dynamically generate follow-up questions, thereby improving evidence collection and reasoning."
    },
    "key_innovation": "The system leverages a multi-turn questioning approach allowing the model to refine its evidence through iterative reasoning, making the verification process more rational and interpretable.",
    "real_world_impact": "This method could significantly enhance fact-checking in health-related fields, providing a model for tackling misinformation and improving public health communication.",
    "limitations": "The reliance on external APIs for LLMs can lead to slower processing speeds compared to traditional models; it also may misclassify claims due to knowledge conflicts.",
    "new_terms": {
        "fact verification": "**Fact verification** is the process of assessing the truthfulness of claims using evidence to inform correct conclusions.",
        "large language models (LLMs)": "**Large language models (LLMs)** are advanced artificial intelligence systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language."
    },
    "open_sourcing": "The authors have provided their data and code in a public GitHub repository."
