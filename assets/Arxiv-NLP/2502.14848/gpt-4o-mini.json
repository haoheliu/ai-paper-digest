    "background": "The study addresses the challenge of developing reusable toolsets through a framework that dynamically constructs an adaptive tool graph based on task requirements.",
    "contribution": "This paper introduces GATE, a framework that evolves a hierarchical tool graph to efficiently construct and evolve toolsets across various tasks, achieving faster milestone completion and improved performance in multi-task scenarios.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Prior methods faced issues like tool redundancy, specialized task applicability, and inefficiencies in tool creation.",
        "novelty": "This work enhances tool creation efficiency by assembling tools from existing ones rather than creating them from scratch, allowing for adaptive evolution and pruning of unnecessary tools."
