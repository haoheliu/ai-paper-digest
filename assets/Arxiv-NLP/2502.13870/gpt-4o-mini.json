    "relevance_why": "The methods proposed in SPEX could enhance understanding of feature interactions in audio models or other generative models. These insights could be leveraged to improve audio generation tasks, especially in manipulating latent representations.",
    "field": "Deep Learning-Generative Models",
    "background": "Identifying crucial interactions among features in large language models (LLMs) to better explain model outputs and decision-making processes, especially in high-stakes applications.",
    "contribution": "SPEX introduces a sparse Fourier transform approach to efficiently scale interaction attribution methods for large input spaces in LLMs, achieving improved output reconstruction fidelity.",
    "technical_comparison": {
        "prior_work": "Previous methods like SHAP and LIME focus on marginal attributions and struggle with scaling and capturing interactions in inputs larger than 20 features.",
        "novelty": "This work improves by utilizing a sparse Fourier transform and leveraging channel coding techniques to enable interaction attribution at scale (\u22481000 features) with significantly lower computational complexity."
    },
    "key_innovation": "Combines sparse Fourier transforms with channel decoding algorithms to identify important input interactions without exhaustive searches.",
    "real_world_impact": "SPEX could boost model transparency and performance in critical areas such as healthcare and legal domains by explaining LLM outputs more effectively, potentially influencing decision-making processes.",
    "limitations": "The algorithm relies on the assumption of sparsity among interactions, which may not hold in all practical scenarios.",
    "new_terms": {
        "sparse Fourier transform": "**Sparse Fourier transform** is an algorithmic technique that allows for efficient computation of the Fourier transform focusing on non-zero coefficients, enhancing performance in high-dimensional spaces."
